# MiForum
I am new to Android App Development and i've always wanted to make a  MiForum App for all Mi Consumers.
So i've made a simple app with WebView Component. It was working fine until i changed something and now when i open this app in my Emulator it crashes.
Plz Help!
PS : Also if someone can suggest a way by which i can cover up entire device space when the app is running it would be great!
